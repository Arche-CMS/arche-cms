# Introduction

Altrugenix CMS is a **file-based, developer-first, open-source headless CMS**. Schema is stored in source files, not in the database — inspired by Strapi and Payload, but designed for type safety, extensibility, and excellent developer experience.

## Philosophy

- **Schema as code** — your content model lives in TypeScript files, version-controlled alongside your application
- **Code generation** — types, APIs, validation, and migrations are auto-generated from schema definitions
- **Zero lock-in** — self-hosted, open-source, standard technologies (TypeScript, Fastify, Drizzle ORM)
- **Pluggable by design** — every part of the system is extensible via plugins, hooks, and events
