# Product Requirements Document — Altrugenix CMS

> **Status:** Draft v1
> **Last Updated:** July 8, 2026

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Altrugenix CMS is a modern, open-source, developer-first headless content management system. Schema definitions live in source code files rather than the database — making the file system the single source of truth for content models. The CMS automatically generates types, database schemas, migrations, APIs (REST + GraphQL), validation, and admin UI from these schema files.

The project is inspired by Strapi and Payload but differentiated by its file-first approach, clean architecture, type safety, and extensive plugin system.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Existing headless CMS solutions suffer from:

- **Schema lock-in:** Collection definitions stored in the database make version control, code review, and collaboration difficult.
- **Limited type safety:** Runtime-generated schemas produce weak or no TypeScript types.
- **Poor DX:** Admin UIs for schema editing often lag, break, or produce opaque output.
- **Architecture debt:** Many CMS platforms prioritize speed over clean architecture, leading to maintenance challenges at scale.

## 7. User Stories

### Developer

```
As a developer, I want to define my content model in a TypeScript file
so that I can version control it, review changes in PRs, and get full type safety.
```

```
As a developer, I want to run `cms generate` to produce types, routes, and migrations
from my schema files so that I don't write boilerplate.
```

```
As a developer, I want to extend the CMS with a plugin
so that I can add custom functionality without forking the core.
```

### Content Editor

```
As a content editor, I want to create and edit content in an admin panel
so that I don't need to interact with code or API tools.
```

```
As a content editor, I want to preview changes before publishing
so that I can verify content appears correctly.
```

### Administrator

```
As an administrator, I want to assign roles and permissions to users
so that team members only access what they need.
```

## 8. Technical Requirements

### 8.1 Performance

- Admin panel load under 2s (cold start)
- API response under 200ms (p95) for read operations
- Cold start schema loading under 500ms for 50+ collections

### 8.2 Security

- JWT with configurable expiry and refresh rotation
- RBAC at field-level granularity
- Input validation via auto-generated Zod schemas
- CSRF protection, rate limiting, security headers

### 8.3 Compatibility

- Node.js 20+ LTS
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge — last 2 major versions)
- SQLite (file-based) for local dev; PostgreSQL for production

### 8.4 Portability

- Zero external service dependencies for basic operation
- SQLite default — no DB server needed for local development

---

## 9. Architecture Constraints

- Schema is the source of truth — never stored in DB
- All packages are independently testable
- Plugin system must not require core modifications
- Database adapters are swappable via interface
- API generation is driven by schema metadata, not runtime reflection
