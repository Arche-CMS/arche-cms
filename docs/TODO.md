# TODO — Arche CMS

> Project status: Milestone 9 complete. All 20 test packages pass (zero failures). Fixed pre-existing test failures: API mock adapter conflated internal tables (version history entries leaked into posts map); schema watcher tests made robust via polling instead of fixed delays. Publish workflow configured (with `workflow_dispatch`, provenance, GitHub Releases). Pending `NPM_TOKEN` secret + `@arche-cms` npm org setup.

## Milestone 9: Standalone CMS App (Next)

### Objective

Make `cms dev` work like Strapi — a single command that starts a full CMS server (REST + GraphQL + admin panel) with zero configuration. The package `@arche-cms/cms` exposes a `cms` binary so it works via:

```bash
npm install -g @arche-cms/cms     # global install → `cms dev`
npm install @arche-cms/cms         # local dep → `pnpm cms dev` / `npx cms dev`
npx @arche-cms/cms dev             # one-off, no install
```

Currently the API server lives in `packages/cms/api` and the CLI is a schema watcher that doesn't start an HTTP server.

### CLI Server Integration (`packages/cms`)

- [x] Move server bootstrap code from `packages/cms/api/src/index.ts` into `packages/cms/src/commands/dev.ts`
- [x] Support flags: `--port`, `--host`, `--schema-dir`, `--db-url`, `--db-adapter`
- [x] Auto-detect and create SQLite database file on first run (`cms.db`)
- [x] Add all server dependencies to CLI package.json
- [x] Copy all API server code (plugins, routes, services) into `packages/cms/src/server/`
- [x] Extract shared bootstrap logic into `packages/cms/src/server/bootstrap.ts`
- [x] Wire schema watcher into server hot-reload (debounced close + re-create Fastify)
- [x] Add `cms start` command for production (no file watching, no hot-reload)
- [x] Auto-migrate on startup: `getExistingSchema` added to DatabaseAdapter interface and implemented in SQLite + Postgres adapters; `connectAndLoad` now generates and runs pending migrations
- [ ] **Verify `cms dev` starts REST + GraphQL APIs in standalone app** — scaffold a project with `npx @arche-cms/create-app`, run `cd <project> && pnpm install && pnpm dev`, then test `GET /api/posts`, `POST /api/posts`, GraphQL at `/graphql`, Swagger at `/docs` (blocked: needs v0.1.2 published with fixed workspace:* deps)
- [ ] **Verify `cms dev` serves admin panel** — check that `http://localhost:3000` renders the admin login page (blocked: needs v0.1.2 published with bundled admin)

### Admin Panel Bundling (`packages/cms/admin`)

- [x] Make the admin panel build to a static directory that the API server serves
- [x] Configure Vite build output — production mode uses relative API URLs
- [x] Serve static admin panel from Fastify with SPA `index.html` fallback via `@fastify/static`
- [x] Add environment-aware admin URL: dev uses Vite dev server (port 5173), production uses bundled static
- [x] Auto-build admin panel as part of `cms build` pipeline before server build
- [x] **Bundle admin panel build with published `@arche-cms/cms` package** — Vite builds to `packages/cms/admin/dist/`; `"files": ["admin"]` in `packages/cms/package.json` includes it in the published package; `registerAdminStatic` resolves from `import.meta.url` to find the dist
- [x] **Serve admin panel in `cms dev`** — added `ensureAdminBuild()` check: if bundled admin dist is missing and monorepo `packages/cms/admin/` exists, auto-builds it with `pnpm --filter @arche-cms/admin build` and serves from `admin/dist/`

### Package Restructuring

- [x] Rename `@arche-cms/cli` → `@arche-cms/cms` as the main package
- [x] Rename directory `packages/cli/` → `packages/cms/`
- [x] Update all workspace references, docs, changesets, lockfile
- [x] Rename npm scope `@altrugenix/*` → `@arche-cms/*` across entire monorepo (560+ occurrences)
- [x] Verify `packages/cms/bin/cms.js` entry point with proper shebang
- [x] Verify pack tarball: 42KB, includes `dist/` + `bin/cms.js` + `package.json` with resolved workspace versions
- [x] Bump all packages to v0.1.0 via changeset
- [x] Fix bin field format in cms (object form required for scoped packages)
- [x] Create publish workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml` with changesets/action)
- [x] Add `workflow_dispatch` trigger for manual publishing
- [x] Enable npm provenance (`NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE`) and GitHub Release creation
- [ ] **Manual:** Set `NPM_TOKEN` as a GitHub Actions secret in repo settings
- [ ] **Manual:** Ensure `@arche-cms` org exists on npm with publish-capable token
- [x] **Create changeset (`fix-workspace-deps.md`)** — bumps 11 affected packages to 0.1.2; ready to push, merge, and publish
- [ ] **Manual:** Push to `main`, the auto-generated Version Packages PR will appear (requires "Allow GitHub Actions to create PRs" enabled), merge it, and publishing happens automatically

### Scaffolding (`@arche-cms/create-app`)

- [x] Create `packages/create-app/` with `@arche-cms/create-app` CLI
- [x] Prompt for project name, database choice, default locale
- [x] Scaffold example project with `cms/collections/`, `cms/globals/`, `.env`, config
- [x] Add `"dev": "cms dev"`, `"build": "cms build"`, `"start": "cms start"` scripts
- [x] Fix bin field format (unscoped package — string form is fine)
- [x] Create publish workflow (same publish.yml handles all packages including this one)

### Production Build (`cms build`)

- [x] Build admin panel + server code in one command
- [x] Support `--out-dir` flag with full production bundle assembly (copies admin build + server dist + generates package.json/Dockerfile)
- [x] Generate `package.json`, `Dockerfile`, and `.dockerignore` in output
- [x] **Include admin build in production bundle** — `cms build` now copies admin build to `packages/cms/admin/` as part of the build pipeline; `cms build --out-dir` includes admin files in the output bundle; Dockerfile updated to Node 24 + pnpm

### Documentation

- [x] Update root README with `npx @arche-cms/cms dev` quick start
- [x] Write "Usage as a Standalone App" guide in `docs/standalone-usage.md`
- [x] Update scaffold template to use pnpm
- [ ] **Update standalone-usage.md** — document that `cms dev` starts a full server with REST + GraphQL APIs at `localhost:3000`, admin panel at `localhost:3000`, and Swagger at `/docs`; include a "What you get" section showing the default posts collection API endpoints
- [ ] Create v0.2.0 release (after npm publish via GitHub Actions — tag + GitHub Release)

---

## Milestone 10: Admin UI Bug Fixes & Feature Gaps

### Status

`cms dev` verified working end-to-end via Playwright:

- Registration (POST `/api/auth/register` → 201, auto-login)
- Dashboard loads stats (collections, entries, media, users — all API calls return 200)
- Collections page lists "Posts" with 4 fields
- Globals page lists "Site Settings" with 6 fields
- Zero console errors. The root cause was a **stale admin build** — the `VITE_API_URL` was previously hardcoded to `http://localhost:3000` instead of `""` (same-origin), or the admin dist was not rebuilt after API route changes. Rebuilding the admin (`pnpm build:admin`) produces `const Xs=""` and `const jo=""` in the compiled JS, making all API calls use relative URLs — which works correctly when served from the same Fastify server.

### Critical — Data Not Loading in Admin UI

- [x] **Diagnose loading spinner freeze** — verified in Playwright: auth flow works, all API calls succeed (200), zero console errors. Root cause was stale admin build — fixed by rebuilding admin with `VITE_API_URL=""`.
- [x] **Fix loading issue** — resolved by the admin rebuild in Milestone 9 bundling work.

### Medium — Missing UI Elements

- [x] **Add "Create User" button + `/users/new` route** — added `routes/users/new.tsx` with email + password form, `createUser()` in `api.ts` (calls `POST /api/auth/register` with admin token), registered route in `router.tsx`, and "Add User" button in users list header.
- [x] **Add "Create Collection" button on `/collections`** — added link to `/schemas/new` (Schema Builder) with "Create Collection" button in collections list header.

### Medium — Settings Page Defaults

- [x] **Settings page works with existing `site-settings` global** — test-cms already has `cms/globals/site-settings.ts`. The scaffold template (`@arche-cms/create-app`) generates a `site-settings` global by default. If missing, the informative error message "Settings global not found. Create cms/globals/site-settings.ts" is shown.

### Low — Tech Debt

- [x] **Fix hardcoded locale list** — 3 files (`collections/$slug.tsx`, `new.$slug.tsx`, `$id_.$slug.edit.tsx`) now read from `collection.localization?.locales ?? ["en"]` instead of hardcoding EN/FR/DE/ES/JA/ZH.
- [x] **Add password change field to Edit User** — `auth/src/service.ts:updateUser()` now accepts and hashes `password`; `routes/users/$id.tsx` shows "New Password" input (blank = keep current); `api.ts:updateUser()` accepts `password`; `cms/src/server/routes/users.ts` passes `password` through.
- [x] **Coerce types in Settings/Global editors** — `settings/index.tsx` and `globals/$slug.tsx` changed from `Record<string, string>` to `Record<string, unknown>`; initial values preserve original types instead of coercing via `String()`; required validation checks `""`/`null` instead of falsy (to allow `false`/`0`).
- [x] **Fix unused `schema` state in Schema Editor** — removed unused `useState<SchemaInfo | null>(null)` from `schemas/$type.$slug.tsx`.
- [x] **Silent error swallowing on Dashboard** — `routes/index.tsx` now captures errors into `dashboardError` state and renders a `bg-destructive/10` banner when set.
- [x] **Add cancelled flag to Create Entry effect** — `new.$slug.tsx` now uses `let cancelled = false` guard pattern consistent with other routes.
- [x] **Redundant API calls** — added `DataProvider` (React Context) at `lib/data.tsx` that fetches collections/globals once. `useCollections()`, `useGlobals()`, `useCollection(slug)`, `useGlobal(slug)` hooks shared by Sidebar, CommandPalette, Dashboard, and all collection/global/settings pages. Single fetch replaces N+1 per navigation.

## Milestone 11: Test Coverage Expansion

### Status

Current baseline: ~379 real test cases across 16 packages. Key gaps in validation coverage, schema loader, plugin discovery, CMS server routes/plugins, storage adapters, and scaffolding CLI.

### Validation Package (`packages/validation`)

- [x] **Field type coverage** — 12 new tests for: `password`, `media`, `upload`, `radio` (with options), `select` (without options), `array`/`repeater`/`object`/`group` (without and with sub-fields), `tabs` (with/without tabs), unknown default type
- [x] **Localization** — 3 tests covering `fieldToZodSchema(field, true)` with localized field, non-localized field, and `localize=false` with localized field
- [x] **Custom validation function** — 1 test for `validation.custom` applied as `refine()`
- [x] **Pattern validation on email/url** — 2 tests for regex pattern on email and url types
- [x] **Combined validators** — 1 test for concurrent minLength + maxLength + pattern
- [x] **Create schema extras** — 3 tests for `_status` with drafts, `_publishAt` with scheduledPublishing, both together
- [x] **Update schema extras** — 2 tests for `_status` and `_publishAt` in update variant
- [x] **Custom validation message** — 5 tests covering custom messages for minLength, maxLength, min, max, pattern

---

## Milestone 12: Server Route Completeness & Tech Debt

### Overview

Reviewed all 22 server-side files for route completeness, comparing `packages/cms/src/server/routes/` (6 files), `plugins/` (10 files), `lib/` (2 files), services/ (1 file), bootstrap/config/app (3 files) with the admin API client (`admin/lib/api.ts`). All routes are registered and functional.

### Completed (Milestone 12)

- [x] **POST /api/users route** — Added to `routes/users.ts:22` with `requirePermission("create", "users")` guard. Uses `authService.register(body)` — same logic as `/api/auth/register` but without the setup-guard check.
- [x] **createUser calls POST /api/users** — `admin/lib/api.ts:263` now calls `POST /api/users` via `apiFetch()` instead of `POST /api/auth/register`.
- [x] **bulkDelete in admin api.ts** — Added `bulkDelete(path, ids)` function at `admin/lib/api.ts:70`. Uses `POST /api/:path/bulk-delete`.
- [x] **Configurable activity table name** — `activity.ts:12` now reads `process.env.CMS_ACTIVITY_TABLE` with fallback to `__cms_activity`. Exported as `ACTIVITY_TABLE`.

### Verified — No Action Needed

- **GET /api/media/file/:id** — Already wired at `media.ts:188`. The route was always registered.
- **Content-Type ordering in serveFile** — Already correct: `reply.type(typed.mimeType)` at line 202, `reply.send(stream)` at line 205. Type is set before send.
- **No unused route functions** — All exported functions in route files are registered on Fastify or used within the file.
- **Role ID handling** — `roles.ts` uses consistent string-based IDs throughout. The `toString()` reference was from an older version.

### Deferred

- **Version history / localization in admin API client** — Server routes exist (`/api/:path/:id/versions`, `/api/:path/:id/versions/:versionId/restore`, and localized variants) but the admin UI lacks UI for versions and localized content. Will be addressed in a future milestone.
