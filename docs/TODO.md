# TODO — Altrugenix CMS

> Project status: Milestone 8 complete. **~430 tests** across all packages. Documentation site live at apps/docs. Audits complete (performance, security, accessibility). All content workflow features done (draft/publish, soft delete, scheduled publishing, version history, localization). Standalone app started — `cms dev` now starts a full Fastify server with REST + GraphQL + schema watching.

## Milestone 9: Standalone CMS App (Next)

### Objective

Make `cms dev` work like Strapi — a single command that starts a full CMS server (REST + GraphQL + admin panel) with zero configuration. The package `@altrugenix/cms` (currently `@altrugenix/cli`) exposes a `cms` binary so it works via:

```bash
npm install -g @altrugenix/cms     # global install → `cms dev`
npm install @altrugenix/cms         # local dep → `yarn cms dev` / `npx cms dev`
npx @altrugenix/cms dev             # one-off, no install
```

Currently the API server lives in `apps/api` and the CLI is a schema watcher that doesn't start an HTTP server.

### CLI Server Integration (`packages/cli`)

- [x] Move server bootstrap code from `apps/api/src/index.ts` into `packages/cli/src/commands/dev.ts` — `cms dev` now starts a real Fastify HTTP server with REST + GraphQL
- [x] Support flags: `--port`, `--host`, `--schema-dir`, `--db-url`, `--db-adapter` (sqlite/postgres)
- [x] Auto-detect and create SQLite database file on first run (`cms.db`)
- [x] Add all server dependencies to CLI package.json (fastify, mercurius, auth, permissions, etc.)
- [x] Copy all API server code (plugins, routes, services) into `packages/cli/src/server/`
- [ ] Run schema migrations automatically on startup
- [ ] Wire schema watcher into server hot-reload (reload schemas without restart)
- [ ] Add `cms start` command for production (no file watching, optimized)

### Admin Panel Bundling (`apps/admin`)

- [ ] Make the admin panel build to a static directory that the API server serves
- [ ] Configure Vite build to output to `apps/api/public/`
- [ ] Serve static admin panel from Fastify with fallback to `index.html` for SPA routing
- [ ] Add environment-aware admin URL: dev uses Vite dev server (port 5173), production uses bundled static

### Package Restructuring

- [ ] Rename `@altrugenix/cli` → `@altrugenix/cms` as the main package
- [ ] Add all server dependencies to the CLI package (fastify, database adapters, auth, etc.)
- [ ] Create `packages/cms/bin/cms.js` entry point with proper shebang
- [ ] Ensure `cms dev` works via `npx @altrugenix/cms` without cloning the monorepo
- [ ] Verify published package is <10MB (exclude dev files, tests, source maps)

### Scaffolding (`create-altrugenix-app`)

- [ ] Create `packages/create-app/` with `create-altrugenix-app` CLI
- [ ] Prompt for project name, database choice (SQLite/PostgreSQL), default locale
- [ ] Scaffold a minimal project: `package.json`, `cms/collections/`, `cms/globals/`, `cms/components/`, `.env`, `altrugenix.config.ts`
- [ ] Add `"dev": "cms dev"` and `"build": "cms build"` scripts to scaffolded `package.json`
- [ ] Publish `create-altrugenix-app` to npm

### Production Build (`cms build`)

- [ ] Update `cms build` to compile the API server + admin panel into a production bundle
- [ ] Support `--out-dir` flag for output directory
- [ ] Generate `package.json`, `Dockerfile`, and `.dockerignore` in output

### Documentation & Release

- [ ] Update root README with `npx @altrugenix/cms dev` quick start
- [ ] Write "Usage as a Standalone App" guide in docs
- [ ] Create v0.2.0 release with all changes
- [ ] Publish `@altrugenix/cms` and `create-altrugenix-app` to npm
