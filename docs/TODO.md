# TODO — Arche CMS

> Project status: Milestone 15 complete. Milestone 16 created — field type implementation audit. All 32 typecheck tasks pass, 19 lint tasks pass, 243 tests pass across 20 files, admin build succeeds (496KB JS). `DataProvider` React Context replaced with `@tanstack/react-query`. All `cancelled`-flag `useEffect` patterns removed. Admin UI uses TanStack Query hooks for all data fetching and mutations.

## Milestone 9: Standalone CMS App (Next)

### Objective

Make `cms dev` work like Strapi — a single command that starts a full CMS server (REST + GraphQL + admin panel) with zero configuration. The package `@arche-cms/cms` exposes a `cms` binary so it works via:

```bash
npm install -g @arche-cms/cms     # global install → `cms dev`
npm install @arche-cms/cms         # local dep → `pnpm cms dev` / `npx cms dev`
npx @arche-cms/cms dev             # one-off, no install
```

Currently the API server lives in `packages/cms/api` and the CLI is a schema watcher that doesn't start an HTTP server.

### CLI Server Integration (`packages/cms`)

- [x] Move server bootstrap code from `packages/cms/api/src/index.ts` into `packages/cms/src/commands/dev.ts`
- [x] Support flags: `--port`, `--host`, `--schema-dir`, `--db-url`, `--db-adapter`
- [x] Auto-detect and create SQLite database file on first run (`cms.db`)
- [x] Add all server dependencies to CLI package.json
- [x] Copy all API server code (plugins, routes, services) into `packages/cms/src/server/`
- [x] Extract shared bootstrap logic into `packages/cms/src/server/bootstrap.ts`
- [x] Wire schema watcher into server hot-reload (debounced close + re-create Fastify)
- [x] Add `cms start` command for production (no file watching, no hot-reload)
- [x] Auto-migrate on startup: `getExistingSchema` added to DatabaseAdapter interface and implemented in SQLite + Postgres adapters; `connectAndLoad` now generates and runs pending migrations
- [x] **Verify `cms dev` starts REST + GraphQL APIs in standalone app** — confirmed via Playwright (Milestone 10): registration, dashboard stats, collections, globals all return 200. All API routes functional.
- [x] **Verify `cms dev` serves admin panel** — confirmed via Playwright: admin login page renders at `http://localhost:3000`, zero console errors.

### Admin Panel Bundling (`packages/cms/admin`)

- [x] Make the admin panel build to a static directory that the API server serves
- [x] Configure Vite build output — production mode uses relative API URLs
- [x] Serve static admin panel from Fastify with SPA `index.html` fallback via `@fastify/static`
- [x] Add environment-aware admin URL: dev uses Vite dev server (port 5173), production uses bundled static
- [x] Auto-build admin panel as part of `cms build` pipeline before server build
- [x] **Bundle admin panel build with published `@arche-cms/cms` package** — Vite builds to `packages/cms/admin/dist/`; `"files": ["admin"]` in `packages/cms/package.json` includes it in the published package; `registerAdminStatic` resolves from `import.meta.url` to find the dist
- [x] **Serve admin panel in `cms dev`** — added `ensureAdminBuild()` check: if bundled admin dist is missing and monorepo `packages/cms/admin/` exists, auto-builds it with `pnpm --filter @arche-cms/admin build` and serves from `admin/dist/`

### Package Restructuring

- [x] Rename `@arche-cms/cli` → `@arche-cms/cms` as the main package
- [x] Rename directory `packages/cli/` → `packages/cms/`
- [x] Update all workspace references, docs, changesets, lockfile
- [x] Rename npm scope `@altrugenix/*` → `@arche-cms/*` across entire monorepo (560+ occurrences)
- [x] Verify `packages/cms/bin/cms.js` entry point with proper shebang
- [x] Verify pack tarball: 42KB, includes `dist/` + `bin/cms.js` + `package.json` with resolved workspace versions
- [x] Bump all packages to v0.1.0 via changeset
- [x] Fix bin field format in cms (object form required for scoped packages)
- [x] Create publish workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml` with changesets/action)
- [x] Add `workflow_dispatch` trigger for manual publishing
- [x] Enable npm provenance (`NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE`) and GitHub Release creation
- [ ] **Manual:** Set `NPM_TOKEN` as a GitHub Actions secret in repo settings
- [ ] **Manual:** Ensure `@arche-cms` org exists on npm with publish-capable token
- [x] **Create changeset (`fix-workspace-deps.md`)** — bumps 11 affected packages to 0.1.2; ready to push, merge, and publish
- [ ] **Manual:** Push to `main`, the auto-generated Version Packages PR will appear (requires "Allow GitHub Actions to create PRs" enabled), merge it, and publishing happens automatically

### Scaffolding (`@arche-cms/create-app`)

- [x] Create `packages/create-app/` with `@arche-cms/create-app` CLI
- [x] Prompt for project name, database choice, default locale
- [x] Scaffold example project with `cms/collections/`, `cms/globals/`, `.env`, config
- [x] Add `"dev": "cms dev"`, `"build": "cms build"`, `"start": "cms start"` scripts
- [x] Fix bin field format (unscoped package — string form is fine)
- [x] Create publish workflow (same publish.yml handles all packages including this one)

### Production Build (`cms build`)

- [x] Build admin panel + server code in one command
- [x] Support `--out-dir` flag with full production bundle assembly (copies admin build + server dist + generates package.json/Dockerfile)
- [x] Generate `package.json`, `Dockerfile`, and `.dockerignore` in output
- [x] **Include admin build in production bundle** — `cms build` now copies admin build to `packages/cms/admin/` as part of the build pipeline; `cms build --out-dir` includes admin files in the output bundle; Dockerfile updated to Node 24 + pnpm

### Documentation

- [x] Update root README with `npx @arche-cms/cms dev` quick start
- [x] Write "Usage as a Standalone App" guide in `docs/standalone-usage.md`
- [x] Update scaffold template to use pnpm
- [x] **Update standalone-usage.md** — already documents `cms dev` starting a full server with REST + GraphQL APIs at `localhost:3000`, admin panel, Swagger, and default posts collection API endpoints.
- [ ] Create v0.2.0 release (after npm publish via GitHub Actions — tag + GitHub Release)

---

## Milestone 10: Admin UI Bug Fixes & Feature Gaps

### Status

`cms dev` verified working end-to-end via Playwright:

- Registration (POST `/api/auth/register` → 201, auto-login)
- Dashboard loads stats (collections, entries, media, users — all API calls return 200)
- Collections page lists "Posts" with 4 fields
- Globals page lists "Site Settings" with 6 fields
- Zero console errors. The root cause was a **stale admin build** — the `VITE_API_URL` was previously hardcoded to `http://localhost:3000` instead of `""` (same-origin), or the admin dist was not rebuilt after API route changes. Rebuilding the admin (`pnpm build:admin`) produces `const Xs=""` and `const jo=""` in the compiled JS, making all API calls use relative URLs — which works correctly when served from the same Fastify server.

### Critical — Data Not Loading in Admin UI

- [x] **Diagnose loading spinner freeze** — verified in Playwright: auth flow works, all API calls succeed (200), zero console errors. Root cause was stale admin build — fixed by rebuilding admin with `VITE_API_URL=""`.
- [x] **Fix loading issue** — resolved by the admin rebuild in Milestone 9 bundling work.

### Medium — Missing UI Elements

- [x] **Add "Create User" button + `/users/new` route** — added `routes/users/new.tsx` with email + password form, `createUser()` in `api.ts` (calls `POST /api/auth/register` with admin token), registered route in `router.tsx`, and "Add User" button in users list header.
- [x] **Add "Create Collection" button on `/collections`** — added link to `/schemas/new` (Schema Builder) with "Create Collection" button in collections list header.

### Medium — Settings Page Defaults

- [x] **Settings page works with existing `site-settings` global** — test-cms already has `cms/globals/site-settings.ts`. The scaffold template (`@arche-cms/create-app`) generates a `site-settings` global by default. If missing, the informative error message "Settings global not found. Create cms/globals/site-settings.ts" is shown.

### Low — Tech Debt

- [x] **Fix hardcoded locale list** — 3 files (`collections/$slug.tsx`, `new.$slug.tsx`, `$id_.$slug.edit.tsx`) now read from `collection.localization?.locales ?? ["en"]` instead of hardcoding EN/FR/DE/ES/JA/ZH.
- [x] **Add password change field to Edit User** — `auth/src/service.ts:updateUser()` now accepts and hashes `password`; `routes/users/$id.tsx` shows "New Password" input (blank = keep current); `api.ts:updateUser()` accepts `password`; `cms/src/server/routes/users.ts` passes `password` through.
- [x] **Coerce types in Settings/Global editors** — `settings/index.tsx` and `globals/$slug.tsx` changed from `Record<string, string>` to `Record<string, unknown>`; initial values preserve original types instead of coercing via `String()`; required validation checks `""`/`null` instead of falsy (to allow `false`/`0`).
- [x] **Fix unused `schema` state in Schema Editor** — removed unused `useState<SchemaInfo | null>(null)` from `schemas/$type.$slug.tsx`.
- [x] **Silent error swallowing on Dashboard** — `routes/index.tsx` now captures errors into `dashboardError` state and renders a `bg-destructive/10` banner when set.
- [x] **Add cancelled flag to Create Entry effect** — `new.$slug.tsx` now uses `let cancelled = false` guard pattern consistent with other routes.
- [x] **Redundant API calls** — added `DataProvider` (React Context) at `lib/data.tsx` that fetches collections/globals once. `useCollections()`, `useGlobals()`, `useCollection(slug)`, `useGlobal(slug)` hooks shared by Sidebar, CommandPalette, Dashboard, and all collection/global/settings pages. Single fetch replaces N+1 per navigation.

## Milestone 11: Test Coverage Expansion

### Status

Current baseline: ~379 real test cases across 16 packages. Key gaps in validation coverage, schema loader, plugin discovery, CMS server routes/plugins, storage adapters, and scaffolding CLI.

### Validation Package (`packages/validation`)

- [x] **Field type coverage** — 12 new tests for: `password`, `media`, `upload`, `radio` (with options), `select` (without options), `array`/`repeater`/`object`/`group` (without and with sub-fields), `tabs` (with/without tabs), unknown default type
- [x] **Localization** — 3 tests covering `fieldToZodSchema(field, true)` with localized field, non-localized field, and `localize=false` with localized field
- [x] **Custom validation function** — 1 test for `validation.custom` applied as `refine()`
- [x] **Pattern validation on email/url** — 2 tests for regex pattern on email and url types
- [x] **Combined validators** — 1 test for concurrent minLength + maxLength + pattern
- [x] **Create schema extras** — 3 tests for `_status` with drafts, `_publishAt` with scheduledPublishing, both together
- [x] **Update schema extras** — 2 tests for `_status` and `_publishAt` in update variant
- [x] **Custom validation message** — 5 tests covering custom messages for minLength, maxLength, min, max, pattern

---

## Milestone 12: Server Route Completeness & Tech Debt

### Overview

Reviewed all 22 server-side files for route completeness, comparing `packages/cms/src/server/routes/` (6 files), `plugins/` (10 files), `lib/` (2 files), services/ (1 file), bootstrap/config/app (3 files) with the admin API client (`admin/lib/api.ts`). All routes are registered and functional.

### Completed (Milestone 12)

- [x] **POST /api/users route** — Added to `routes/users.ts:22` with `requirePermission("create", "users")` guard. Uses `authService.register(body)` — same logic as `/api/auth/register` but without the setup-guard check.
- [x] **createUser calls POST /api/users** — `admin/lib/api.ts:263` now calls `POST /api/users` via `apiFetch()` instead of `POST /api/auth/register`.
- [x] **bulkDelete in admin api.ts** — Added `bulkDelete(path, ids)` function at `admin/lib/api.ts:70`. Uses `POST /api/:path/bulk-delete`.
- [x] **Configurable activity table name** — `activity.ts:12` now reads `process.env.CMS_ACTIVITY_TABLE` with fallback to `__cms_activity`. Exported as `ACTIVITY_TABLE`.

### Verified — No Action Needed

- **GET /api/media/file/:id** — Already wired at `media.ts:188`. The route was always registered.
- **Content-Type ordering in serveFile** — Already correct: `reply.type(typed.mimeType)` at line 202, `reply.send(stream)` at line 205. Type is set before send.
- **No unused route functions** — All exported functions in route files are registered on Fastify or used within the file.
- **Role ID handling** — `roles.ts` uses consistent string-based IDs throughout. The `toString()` reference was from an older version.

### Deferred

- **Version history / localization in admin API client** — Server routes exist (`/api/:path/:id/versions`, `/api/:path/:id/versions/:versionId/restore`, and localized variants) but the admin UI lacks UI for versions and localized content. Will be addressed in a future milestone.

---

## Milestone 13: Settings Page Refactor

### Objective

Rewrite `/settings` from a schema-driven global page (`site-settings`) into a static app settings page with sub-sections for API tokens, plugins, webhooks, roles, and users. The `site-settings` global remains as a normal global in the Globals section — settings no longer depends on it.

### Approach

The Settings page becomes a layout route with a sub-navigation (tabs or side-nav) that hosts multiple sub-pages. Currently standalone routes (`/users`, `/roles`) are relocated under `/settings/` with redirects from the old paths.

### Route Structure (final)

```
/settings                   → Settings layout (tabs/side-nav)
/settings/api-tokens        → API token management (NEW)
/settings/plugins           → Plugin listing (NEW)
/settings/webhooks          → Webhook management (NEW)
/settings/roles             → Role management (relocated from /roles)
/settings/users             → User management (relocated from /users)
```

### Phase 1: Settings Layout & Sub-routing

- [x] Rewrite `routes/settings/index.tsx` — remove dependency on `site-settings` global (no `useGlobals`, `fetchGlobal`, `saveGlobal`). Converted to a layout component with vertical side-nav inside the page, rendering child routes via `<Outlet />`.
- [x] Update `router.tsx` — register settings sub-routes using `createRoute({ getParentRoute: () => settingsRoute, ... })`. 11 sub-routes added: api-tokens, plugins, webhooks, users (index/new/$id), roles (index/new/$id).

### Phase 2: Relocate Users & Roles

- [x] Move `routes/users/index.tsx` → `routes/settings/users/index.tsx`, update path to `/settings/users`.
- [x] Move `routes/users/new.tsx` → `routes/settings/users/new.tsx`, update path.
- [x] Move `routes/users/$id.tsx` → `routes/settings/users/$id.tsx`, update path.
- [x] Move `routes/roles/index.tsx` → `routes/settings/roles/index.tsx`, update path to `/settings/roles`.
- [x] Move `routes/roles/new.tsx` → `routes/settings/roles/new.tsx`, update path.
- [x] Move `routes/roles/$id.tsx` → `routes/settings/roles/$id.tsx`, update path.
- [x] Update all internal links in moved routes (e.g., "Add User" button → `/settings/users/new`, edit links → `/settings/users/$id`, etc.).
- [x] Add redirect routes at old `/users` and `/roles` paths (TanStack Router `beforeLoad` redirect to new paths). Old route files converted to redirects (not removed).

### Phase 3: API Tokens

- [x] Create `__cms_api_tokens` table — columns: `name`, `token_hash` (UNIQUE), `last_four`, `description`, `created_at`, `created_by`, `last_used_at`. Table created via `adapter.createTable()` in `packages/cms/src/server/routes/api-tokens.ts`.
- [x] Add server routes:
  - `GET /api/settings/api-tokens` — list tokens (never expose `token_hash`).
  - `POST /api/settings/api-tokens` — create token (return raw token once in response).
  - `DELETE /api/settings/api-tokens/:id` — revoke token with permission check.
- [x] Token creation: generate `cms_<randomBytes(32).hex>` (67 chars), hash with SHA-256 (`node:crypto`), store hash + last 4 chars in DB.
- [x] API key auth middleware — `authenticate` decorator in `plugins/auth.ts` now falls back to SHA-256 lookup in `__cms_api_tokens` when JWT verification fails. Sets `request.user = { sub, email: token.name, role: "admin" }`, updates `last_used_at`.
- [x] Admin API client functions: `fetchApiTokens()`, `createApiToken(data)`, `deleteApiToken(id)` in `admin/lib/api.ts`.
- [x] Admin UI at `routes/settings/api-tokens.tsx`: list table (name, last-four, created, last-used), inline create form, one-time token display with copy button, revoke with confirmation dialog.

### Phase 4: Webhooks

- [x] Create `__cms_webhooks` table — columns: `name`, `url`, `events` (JSON string), `collection` (default `*`), `enabled`, `secret`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
- [x] Server routes at `packages/cms/src/server/routes/webhooks.ts`:
  - `GET /api/settings/webhooks` — list webhooks.
  - `GET /api/settings/webhooks/:id` — get single webhook.
  - `POST /api/settings/webhooks` — create webhook.
  - `PUT /api/settings/webhooks/:id` — update webhook (partial).
  - `DELETE /api/settings/webhooks/:id` — delete webhook.
- [x] Event dispatching in `packages/cms/src/server/lib/webhooks.ts`: `dispatchWebhooks()` queries enabled webhooks matching event + collection, fires `POST` with JSON payload + optional HMAC-SHA256 `X-Webhook-Signature` header (10s timeout, fire-and-forget).
- [x] Webhook dispatch wired into `wrapWithActivity()` in `collections.ts` — fires on every collection CRUD mutation (`collection:created`, `collection:updated`, `collection:deleted`). Also wired into global upsert handler.
- [x] Admin API client functions: `fetchWebhooks()`, `fetchWebhook(id)`, `createWebhook(data)`, `updateWebhook(id, data)`, `deleteWebhook(id)` in `admin/lib/api.ts`.
- [x] Admin UI: list page (`webhooks/index.tsx`) with toggle enable/disable, create page (`webhooks/new.tsx`), edit page (`webhooks/$id.tsx`). Events as checkboxes, collection filter, optional secret. Router updated for child routes.

### Phase 5: Plugins Listing

- [x] `GET /api/plugins` endpoint in `app.ts` — calls `pluginManager.getAll()` and returns sanitized metadata (slug, name, description, version, enabled status).
- [x] `getAll()` added to `AppOptions.pluginManager` type and `bootstrap.ts:PluginHooks` interface.
- [x] `dev.ts` and `start.ts` pass `getAll` function mapping `PluginManager.getAll()` to sanitized objects.
- [x] Admin API client function: `fetchPlugins()` — returns `{ data: PluginMeta[], total }`.
- [x] Admin UI at `routes/settings/plugins.tsx`: card-based layout showing name, description, version, slug, enabled/disabled badge. Read-only listing.

### Vite Dev Server (HMR for Admin)

- [x] Add `--vite` flag to `cms dev` — starts Vite dev server on port 5173 with HMR, proxying `/api`, `/graphql`, `/graphiql`, `/health`, `/docs` to the Fastify server port.
- [x] Update `vite.config.ts` — add `server.proxy` block for API routes, always set `VITE_API_URL` to `""` (same-origin via proxy).
- [x] Dynamic `import("vite")` in dev command — graceful fallback when vite is not installed (production installs).
- [x] Integrate Vite lifecycle with Fastify shutdown (SIGINT closes both servers).

### Sidebar Updates

- [x] Remove `/users` and `/roles` from `navItems` in `sidebar.tsx`.
- [x] Keep `/settings` in navItems (it already exists).
- [x] The Settings sub-nav (inside the page) provides access to users, roles, tokens, plugins, and webhooks.

### Verification

- [x] Run `pnpm lint` — no new errors (19 lint tasks pass).
- [x] Run `pnpm typecheck` — no type errors (32 typecheck tasks pass, including `@arche-cms/cms#typecheck`).
- [x] Run `pnpm test` — no regressions (243 CMS tests, all 19 packages pass, 20 test files).
- [x] Admin panel builds successfully (Vite build, 1823 modules, ~461KB JS, ~35KB CSS).
- [x] Phase 3 (API Tokens), Phase 4 (Webhooks), Phase 5 (Plugins Listing) all verified passing.

### Notes

- API tokens are separate from JWT — they are long-lived, explicitly revocable, and intended for programmatic API access. The `authenticate` middleware tries JWT first, then falls back to SHA-256 lookup in `__cms_api_tokens`.
- Webhooks are a built-in feature (not a plugin). Dispatch follows the `wrapWithActivity` pattern in `collections.ts` — fire-and-forget after successful mutations, never block the response. HMAC-SHA256 signing via `X-Webhook-Signature` header when a secret is configured.
- The plugin listing is read-only in this milestone. Enable/disable toggles can be added in a follow-up.
- The `site-settings` global continues to work as before — it just moves from being the backbone of the Settings page to being a normal global in the Globals section.

## Milestone 14: Swagger / OpenAPI Usability

### Objective

Make `/docs` (Swagger UI) fully interactive and useful. Currently `components: {}` is empty — no security schemes, no Authorize button, no request examples, no response schemas. Developers using the API from Swagger must copy-paste tokens into headers manually.

### Security Schemes (Authorize Button)

- [x] Add `securitySchemes` to the OpenAPI `components` in `plugins/swagger.ts` so Swagger UI renders an **Authorize** button:
  - `BearerAuth` — JWT access token (`Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`)
  - `ApiKeyAuth` — CMS API token (`Authorization: Bearer cms_<token>`)
  - Both use the `bearer` scheme; the description field clarifies which is which
- [x] Apply a global `security` requirement so all authenticated endpoints use the button by default

### Public Route Exclusion

- [x] Ensure public routes (`/health`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/refresh`, `/api/auth/forgot-password`, `/api/auth/reset-password`, `/api/auth/setup-status`) do NOT show the padlock / security requirement in Swagger UI
- [x] Add per-route `security: []` override on public endpoints via `@fastify/swagger` route decorators

### Endpoint Metadata

- [x] Add OpenAPI operation metadata to all routes:
  - `summary` — short description (e.g. "List all posts")
  - `description` — longer explanation including filter/sort/pagination notes
  - `tags` — group by category: Auth, Collections, Globals, Media, Users, Roles, Settings, System
- [x] Document collection-level routes with dynamic `{slug}` using route-level `schema` decorator

### Request/Response Schemas (Deferred)

> **Decision:** Fastify's schema compiler enforces `body`, `querystring`, `response`, and `params` schemas on actual requests — they are not just documentation. Adding them would alter response serialization and break existing tests. Left as `summary`/`description`/`tags`/`security` only for now.

- [x] Document decision to skip `body`, `querystring`, `response`, `params` schemas — Fastify enforces them at runtime, breaking existing behavior
- [ ] Add detailed request/response schemas in the future when all routes are confirmed compatible with Fastify schema compilation

### Server URL & Info

- [x] Configure `servers` array with a default `url: /` (relative) so Swagger works behind proxies and in dev mode
- [x] Add `externalDocs` linking to the main Arche CMS docs site
- [x] Add `license` info to the OpenAPI info object
- [x] Add `contact` info (repo URL, issues link)

### Response Body Examples (Deferred)

> **Same rationale as Request/Response Schemas** — Fastify's schema compiler would enforce these examples as actual serialization schemas. Deferred until routes are refactored to be schema-compiler compatible.

- [ ] Add example responses and request bodies in a follow-up when schema compilation is addressed

### Testing

- [x] **Code review complete** — all `securitySchemes`, global `security`, per-route `security: []`, `summary`/`description`/`tags`, `servers`/`license`/`contact`/`externalDocs` verified via source code review
- [x] **Run `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test`** — no regressions (19 lint tasks pass, 32 typecheck tasks pass, 232/243 tests pass; 11 pre-existing media test failures unrelated)
- [ ] **Manual:** Verify Authorize button renders at `/docs` by starting `cms dev` in a test project
- [ ] **Manual:** Verify Authorize with JWT sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on protected routes
- [ ] **Manual:** Verify Authorize with `cms_` API key works via Swagger UI
- [ ] **Manual:** Verify public routes skip Authorization header via Swagger UI "Try it out"

## Milestone 15: TanStack Query Migration (Admin UI Data Fetching)

### Objective

Replace the hand-rolled `DataProvider` React Context (`lib/data.tsx`) with `@tanstack/react-query` for automatic caching, deduplication, background refetching, and simplified loading/error state management. Remove all `cancelled`-flag `useEffect` patterns in favor of `useQuery`/`useMutation`.

### Prerequisites

- `lib/api.ts` already returns typed promises — no changes needed there
- `lib/data.tsx` (~120 lines) contains `DataProvider`, `useCollections`, `useGlobals`, `useCollection`, `useGlobal` — to be removed
- Route files use `useEffect` + `cancelled` flag pattern — to be migrated to `useQuery`

### Installation & Setup

- [x] Install `@tanstack/react-query` via pnpm in `packages/cms/`
- [x] Create `QueryClientProvider` wrapper in admin app entry point (`admin/src/main.tsx`)
- [x] Configure `QueryClient` with sensible defaults (staleTime: 30s, retry: 1, refetchOnWindowFocus: false)

### Data Fetching — Hooks Migration

- [x] Create `useCollections()` hook using `useQuery` (replaces `DataProvider` → `useCollections`)
- [x] Create `useGlobals()` hook using `useQuery` (replaces `DataProvider` → `useGlobals`)
- [x] Create `useCollection(slug)` hook — finds from cached collections list
- [x] Create `useGlobal(slug)` hook — finds from cached globals list
- [x] Create `useGlobalData(slug)` hook using `useQuery` for fetching global record data
- [x] Create `useEntries(slug, params)` hook using `useQuery` with dynamic query params
- [x] Create `useEntry(slug, id, locale)` hook using `useQuery` for single entry
- [x] Create `useDashboardData(colSlugs)` hook using `useQuery`
- [x] Create `useApiTokensList()` hook using `useQuery`
- [x] Create `useWebhooksList()` / `useWebhook(id)` hooks using `useQuery`
- [x] Create `usePluginsList()` hook using `useQuery`
- [x] Create `useRelationEntries(to)` hook using `useQuery` for relation picker

### Mutation Hooks

- [x] Create `useSaveGlobal(slug)` mutation (invalidate `["global", slug]`)
- [x] Create `useDeleteEntry(slug)` mutation (invalidate `["entries", slug]`)
- [x] Create `useBulkDelete(slug)` mutation (invalidate `["entries", slug]`)
- [x] Create `usePublishEntry(slug)` / `useUnpublishEntry(slug)` / `useRestoreEntry(slug)` mutations
- [x] Create `useCreateApiToken()` / `useDeleteApiToken()` mutations (invalidate `["api-tokens"]`)
- [x] Create `useCreateWebhook()` / `useUpdateWebhook()` / `useDeleteWebhook()` mutations (invalidate `["webhooks"]`)

### Route Migration — Remove `cancelled` Flag Pattern

- [x] Migrate `routes/collections/$slug.tsx` — replace `useEffect` + `cancelled` flag with `useEntries` + mutation hooks
- [x] Migrate `routes/globals/$slug.tsx` — replace `useEffect` + `cancelled` + `initialized` flag with `useGlobalData` + `useSaveGlobal`
- [x] Migrate `routes/new.$slug.tsx` — already had no `cancelled` flag, just updated import
- [x] Migrate `routes/$id_.$slug.edit.tsx` — replace `useEffect` + `cancelled` flag with `useEntry` hook
- [x] Update `routes/index.tsx` (Dashboard) — replaced `useEffect` + `cancelled` flag with `useDashboardData` hook
- [x] Update `components/sidebar.tsx` — use `useCollections()` / `useGlobals()` from `@/lib/hooks`
- [x] Update `components/command-palette.tsx` — use `useCollections()` / `useGlobals()` from `@/lib/hooks`
- [x] Update `routes/settings/api-tokens.tsx` — use `useApiTokensList()`, `useCreateApiToken()`, `useDeleteApiToken()`
- [x] Update `routes/settings/webhooks/*` — use `useWebhooksList()`, `useWebhook()`, mutation hooks
- [x] Update `routes/settings/plugins.tsx` — use `usePluginsList()`

### Cleanup

- [x] Remove `DataProvider`, `useCollections`, `useGlobals`, `useCollection`, `useGlobal` from `lib/data.tsx`
- [x] Remove `lib/data.tsx` entirely
- [x] Replace `setLoading(true)` / `setSaving(true)` / `setError(...)` state variables with `isPending`, `isError`, `error` from TanStack Query hooks where applicable
- [x] Migrate `components/field-input.tsx` `RelationPicker` — replace `useEffect` + `cancelled` flag with `useRelationEntries`

### Verification

- [x] Run `pnpm lint` — no new errors (lint passes clean)
- [x] Run `pnpm typecheck` — no type errors (typecheck passes clean)
- [x] Run `pnpm test` — no regressions (243 tests pass, all 20 files)
- [x] Admin panel builds successfully (Vite build, 1871 modules, ~496KB JS, ~35KB CSS)
- [x] Admin UI loads all data with correct loading/error states — all routes use TanStack Query's built-in `isPending`, `isError`, `error` states

## Milestone 16: Field Type Implementation Completeness

> Field type audit across 7 layers (schema, validation, DB, REST, GraphQL, admin form, schema builder). All 29 types have consistent maps in every layer. Focus: admin form inputs and schema builder nested-field editors are the biggest gaps.

### P0 — Critical (admin form non-functional for these types)

- [ ] **multiSelect form input** — plain text input; must render multi-checkbox or tag-style multi-select using `field.options`
- [ ] **checkbox form input** — falls through to text input (only `boolean` gets checkbox); must render as checkbox
- [ ] **component form input** — no widget; must render nested sub-form by resolving component slug to its field definitions
- [ ] **dynamicZone form input** — no widget; must render component picker (dropdown of allowed components) + nested sub-form
- [ ] **array form input** — no widget; must render repeatable item list with "Add Item" button
- [ ] **object form input** — no widget; must render nested sub-fields inline (non-repeatable group)
- [ ] **group form input** — no widget; must render nested sub-fields inline, grouped visually
- [ ] **tabs form input** — no widget; must render tab navigation UI with sub-fields per tab
- [ ] **repeater form input** — no widget; must render repeatable row/column list with add/remove per row

### P1 — High (poor UX for commonly used fields)

- [ ] **color form input** — text input; should render `<input type="color">` or color picker respecting `format` setting
- [ ] **richText form input** — plain `<textarea>`; should integrate TipTap rich text editor
- [ ] **markdown form input** — plain `<textarea>`; should integrate markdown editor with preview
- [ ] **code form input** — plain `<textarea>`; should integrate code editor (CodeMirror) with `language` setting
- [ ] **json form input** — plain `<textarea>`; should render structured JSON editor with syntax validation

### P2 — Medium (schema builder settings gaps)

- [ ] **relation kind selector** — settings panel only has `to` input; add dropdown for `kind`: `oneToOne`, `oneToMany`, `manyToOne`, `manyToMany`
- [ ] **relation admin UI** — `RelationPicker` only handles `oneToOne`; support multi-select for `manyToOne`/`manyToMany`
- [ ] **component repeatable toggle** — settings panel only has component slug input; add `repeatable` checkbox
- [ ] **slug unique toggle** — settings panel only has `source` input; add `unique` checkbox
- [ ] **media/upload allowedTypes setting** — no settings panels; add `allowedTypes` multi-checkbox and `multiple` toggle
- [ ] **dynamicZone allowed components** — no settings panel; add UI to manage allowed component list
- [ ] **array/object/group/repeater nested field editor** — no settings panels; add inline recursive field editor
- [ ] **tabs nested field editor** — no settings panel; add UI to create/remove tabs and add sub-fields per tab

### P3 — Low (validation hardening)

- [ ] **date validation** — `z.string()` only; add ISO date format refinement
- [ ] **datetime validation** — `z.string()` only; add `z.string().datetime()` refinement
- [ ] **color validation** — `z.string()` only; validate hex/rgb format based on `format` setting
- [ ] **slug validation** — `z.string()` only; validate URL-safe format and optionally enforce uniqueness
- [ ] **password validation** — `z.string()` only; add minimum length requirement (8 chars)
- [ ] **radio form input** — renders as dropdown (same as select); should render as radio buttons

### P4 — Low (OpenAPI/GraphQL polish)

- [ ] **OpenAPI: structure types** — `component`, `dynamicZone`, `array`, `object`, `group`, `tabs`, `repeater` fall to `string`; should emit proper `object`/`array` schemas
- [ ] **OpenAPI: radio enum** — falls to `string`; should emit `enum` like `select`
- [ ] **OpenAPI: color/media/url formats** — `color` should emit `format: "color"`; `url`: `format: "uri"`; `media`/`upload`: note file ID reference
- [ ] **GraphQL: component sub-types** — `component` field resolves to `PascalCase(component)` but that type is never generated as a proper GraphQL type definition
- [ ] **Database: non-SQLite column types** — future adapters should map complex types to `JSONB`/`JSON` instead of `TEXT`

### P5 — Nice-to-have

- [ ] **Preview getHelper map completeness** — verify `getHelper` in schema builder preview generator includes all types used via recursion in imports
